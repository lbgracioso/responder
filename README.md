# ResponderBot

**A C++ telegram bot to use few specific memes**

I really wanted to create something like that, a bot that creates memes using imgflip.com API and that also sends a few different stuff, like "random commit phrases" or "random facts", even a duck photo. Well, I made it.
That's what it is, basically.

## Features
**Random facts**: You can ask it to send random facts on the chat.

**Random commits**: You can ask it to send random commit messages on the chat.

**Duck photos**: Well, that's it. Funny duck photos.

## Usage
@TODO - I really need to try it out from scratch to write this. It'll take some time ;)
